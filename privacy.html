				<p>Information We Collect From Your Use of the Site</p>

				<p>Parkway collects information about the visitors to the Site. For example, when you visit the Site, Parkway may collect your domain name and IP address, your browser version, the URL from which you arrived at the Site, and the URL to which you go upon leaving the Site, as well as the pages you visit while viewing the Site. IP addresses are numbers that are automatically assigned to your computer, and in many cases may be used to identify you.</p>
				<p>Parkway may also use "cookies" as part of its interaction with your browser. Cookies consist of files of information that we place on your computer and later access to track your &nbsp;activity. Cookies can make your use of the Site more pleasing and efficient by, for example, "personalizing" your user interface or identifying which parts of the Site you have previously visited. Many browsers enable you to refuse cookies or to determine if and how cookies will be accepted by your computer. If you stop or restrict placement of cookies, you may still use the Parkway Site, but some features may not operate correctly or at all. Parkway may also use third party providers to provide cookie-related services to Parkway and both Parkway and such third party providers may also use other tracking technologies to monitor your use of the Site that will function even if you disable cookies. &nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Site is not designed to recognize or honor&nbsp; "do not track" instructions that may be turned on in some browsers.</p>

				<p>Parkway uses the information collected by the methods described above to help diagnose problems with its server, to administer and improve the Site and to respond to improper or unauthorized use of the Site. The information is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information, some or all of which Parkway might share with affiliates and third parties. Parkway also uses the information to keep track of the information you have seen on the Site. We may further personalize your experience by using your Site behavior to shape any recommendations we may make about content (including advertising) that might be of interest to you. We may also monitor traffic patterns and Site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the Site.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Additional Information You Provide Voluntarily</p>

				<p>If you choose to submit any personal information on any page of the Site by completing requests for information or any form (for example, providing your name, company name, street or e-mail address or your telephone number or submitting your resume online or signing up for e-mail updates and alerts), Parkway may collect, retain, use and share that information in aggregated or un-aggregated form. Parkway may use your personal information to respond to your queries, to send you e-mail alerts and updates or other marketing information about employment, various properties, projects or opportunities, or related information.</p>
				<p>Parkway may use the information you provide to provide you with information about Parkway and about Parkway's projects and services, as well as the projects and services of others. Moreover, Parkway may share your information among Parkway affiliates and with third parties that Parkway believes may provide services of interest to you.</p>
				<p>Parkway may also use information it collects in aggregated form to monitor Site performance, use of features and traffic patterns, browser version as well as for any of the purposes in the preceding section (Information Collected When You Use the Site).</p>
				<p>We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about functionality changes to our Site, new services we provide, and offers we think will be of interest to you. We may create from information we collect from you anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, domicile, age, gender, preferences and interests. We may use or permit use of this information with affiliates, advertisers, business partners or unaffiliated third parties for our or their business purposes.</p>

				<p><strong>Sensitive Personal Information</strong></p>

				<p>It is not our intention that the Site be used to collect or process any information relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; personal finances; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; educational records; sexual life or criminal record (together "Sensitive Personal Information").&nbsp; We ask that you not provide any information of this nature.</p>
				<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

				<p>This Site is not designed to store Sensitive Personal Information or other information that could be used for identity theft or financial fraud, and you should not use the Site for that purpose. We believe the Site uses measures that are commercially reasonable to secure your personal information, but we cannot and do not assure that these measures will be sufficient to protect against all efforts to gain unauthorized access to the information or inadvertent disclosures as a result of an error. &nbsp;</p>

				<p><strong>Third Party Sites and Services</strong></p>

				<p>When you use our Site, you may be directed to other sites outside our service. For example, links to sites with information about our operating markets are third-party sites that we do not operate or control. If you click on one of these links, you will leave the Site. These third-party sites may send their own cookies to users to collect data or solicit personal information. These other sites are not subject to our Privacy Policy and we are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third-party sites, or for the use of any information that these sites may collect.</p>

				<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>

				<p>We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy
				Protection Act (COPPA). The Site and our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If a user identifies themself as a child under the age of 13, we will not collect, store or use any personal information. If we receive personal information that we discover was provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly destroy such information. Schools and parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider the use of other means to provide a child-friendly, online environment.

				<p><strong>Transfer of Information to Third Parties and/or Across National Borders</strong></p>

				<p>Parkway may from time to time transfer information collected through the Site to third parties who analyze such information on behalf of Parkway or in connection with a sale or transfer of all or a part of our business. Some of these companies and some of Parkway's affiliates may reside in jurisdictions (for example, states, provinces or countries) other than your own. As a result, your personal information may be transferred out of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Please note that Parkway is headquartered in Florida in the United States of America and that, to the extent you submit any information from outside that jurisdiction, by submitting such information you agree to it being transferred to that jurisdiction. In giving this consent, you acknowledge your understanding that the laws on holding, processing, using and transferring personal information in our jurisdiction and other jurisdictions where your data may be stored or processed may vary and be less protective of your privacy than the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>

				<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
