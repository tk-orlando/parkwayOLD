				<ul class="nc">
					<li>
						<p>The Property Manager will order a general building evacuation when occupants must be removed for their own safety or at the direction of the Fire Department. Notification to evacuate will normally be given by the fire evacuation horns or PA system, but evacuation instructions may be given to Floor Captains by Angus, telephone or word of mouth, starting with the floor or floors where the emergency exists. &nbsp;Occupants of the floor where there is a fire or other emergency will be directed to go to the stairwells and walk down to the exits on the plaza or street level.</p>
						<p>Persons with physical disabilities should be assisted in using the stairwells if they are able to do so. Otherwise, psychically challenged persons should be escorted to a safe location and assistance should be requested. Someone should remain with the person until&nbsp;the emergency is over:&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Visually impaired persons should have an assigned "buddy" to assist them in the event of an evacuation. Ask each person the best way to assist him or her to the stairwell and lead them to safety. It is important that the "buddy" remain with the person until the emergency is over.</p>
						<p>Physically challenged/non-ambulatory persons: Each person should have a "buddy" or "buddies" assigned to assist them in the event of an evacuation. In most incidences, it will only be necessary to move the person into the stairwell for safety. If it becomes necessary to move them down the stairs, various lifting and carrying techniques can be utilized. Ask the person the best way to help them. Stay with the person until the emergency is over. Elevators are restricted for use by the responding emergency unit and cannot be used for Customers or Building Management.</p>
						<p>Evacuees who exit to the building exterior in case of a fire or earthquake should move a safe distance away to avoid possible injury from falling glass and to avoid any interference with emergency services who are responding to the situation.</p>
						<p>Upon exiting Floor Captains will be responsible for ensuring that all persons in their assigned area are accounted for and report to the Property Management Team.</p>
						<p>No one will be allowed to re-enter evacuated areas until it has been determined that the emergency has ended and the fire department has given permission.</p>

			<li class="section"><a class="section" href="#"><span class="collapsible-header">Fire</span></a>
				<ul class="nc">
					<li><p>The [CITY] Fire Department is familiar with the [Building Name]. The Fire Department knows the location of, and has access to, all of the fire fighting systems and equipment in the Building. Tests and inspections of fire protection alarms and components are completed regularly on an approved schedule by a qualified contract alarm service company and building maintenance personnel.</p>
					<p>Fire extinguishers and hose connections are located throughout the building. Fire equipment should be used by trained personnel only.</p>
					<p>During a fire emergency, elevators will NOT be available as a means of egress since all passenger elevators will automatically be brought to the lobby floor.</p>
					<p>The alarms will be activated one floor above and one floor below the actual floor where an alarm condition exists. In the event that other areas become endangered, the alarms for those floors will automatically be activated. During an alarm condition, the alarm tone (slow whoop) will sound along with a recorded message instructing the occupants of that particular floor to evacuate the building.</p>
					<p>The fire alarm may sound for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Activation of fire sprinkler head(s)</li> 
							<li>Activation of smoke detector(s)</li>
							<li>Activation of fire alarm pull box(es)</li>
						</ul>
					<p><strong>If Fire is Discovered in Your Customer Area:</strong></p>
						<dl>
							<dt>STEP 1</dt>
							<dd>Activate the NEAREST FIRE ALARM. Fire alarm pull stations are located next to the stairwells and the freight elevator.</dd>
							<dt>STEP 2</dt>
							<dd>After the alarm has been pulled, notify the Security Desk at [Security Phone] to report the location of the fire.</dd>
							<dt>STEP 3</dt>
							<dd>Do not attempt to extinguish a fire even a minor fire. Never jeopardize your own safety or the safety of others. Trained emergency personnel will be responsible for extinguishing fires.</dd>
							<dt>STEP 4</dt>
							<dd>Follow the Evacuation Procedures below if evacuation is necessary.</dd>
						</dl>
					<p><strong>Evacuation Procedures:</strong></p>
						<dl>
							<dt>STEP 1</dt>
							<dd>
								<ul>
									<li>If a fire alarm sounds on your floor, STAY CALM. Proceed immediately to the nearest stairway marked with an "EXIT" sign. Walk DOWN to the first floor and LEAVE THE BUILDING. Evacuate to a point at least 200 feet from the Building. Do not evacuate to the Parking Garage.</li>
			 						<li>Handicapped and/or disabled persons who are NOT self-ambulatory or able to exit by way of the stairs individually should be moved to the stairway listed on their "Customer Assistance List", and the Fire Department or Property Management office or Security should be notified IMMEDIATELY for assistance.</li>
			 						<li>All handicapped or disabled individuals should be registered with the Property Management office so their floor location will be known in the event of an evacuation.</li>
		 						</ul>
	 						</dd>
							<dt>STEP 2</dt>
							<dd>REMAIN OUTSIDE. Upon determination of the cause for the alarm by Property Management and/or Fire Department Personnel, further instructions will be given.</dd>
							<dt>STEP 3</dd>
							<dd>DO NOT RE-ENTER the building until Property Management and/or Fire Department personnel gives clearance to do so.</dd>
						</dl>
					<p><strong>NOTE: During an evacuation condition, the following rules must be observed:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Keep talking to a minimum.</li>
							<li>Walk in an orderly fashion to the nearest exit.</li>
							<li>Keep to the right and use handrail when maneuvering down stairwells as firefighters will use the inside stairs.</li>
							<li>Do not use elevators.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>If you would like to arrange for the [CITY] Fire Department to give an evacuation briefing at your office meeting, please contact&nbsp;the Property Management office.</p>

				<li>
					<p>If a person observed on the Premises appears to present a threat to the safety of others as indicated by threats, irrational behavior, possession of a weapon, etc., immediately call 911 and request Police assistance. Describe the person(s), location, description and behavior to the 911 operator.&nbsp; Never approach&nbsp;a suspicious person alone.&nbsp; If the person(s) is armed, keep your distance and avoid any confrontation.&nbsp; Notify a member of the Property Management or Security teams to address the situation.</p>
					<p>If it is confirmed that an armed person has gained access to the upper floors, Customers are advised to remain in their offices with the doors locked. &nbsp;The Property Management Team will secure the elevators to limit his/her movement from floor-to-floor. &nbsp;Customers will be notified of the emergency situation and asked to lock their office doors and remain in their offices until further advised.</p>
					<p>Always cooperate with the authorities and follow their instructions. &nbsp;If the elevators are in 'fire service' mode, they will be readily available to police, but they will require assistance and keys to operate them.</p>
					<p>If it is necessary to keep the building secured, Customers will be kept informed by Angus, Email, telephone and/or PA announcements.</p>
